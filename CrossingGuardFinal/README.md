This folder contains python scripts as well as an arduino sketch. This was so that I could physically light up LEDs using an arduino and simulate the traffic light. 
If I ever build a functioning model and implement this on a Raspberry Pi, I will likely use the existing GPIO pins on the Pi to toggle relays and turn on/off the lights.
