Note that some files such as the YOLO weights and config files could not be uploaded. If you wish to run any code in this repository, make sure you have all the referenced files. 

I tried many different methods of detecting cars, and settled on YOLOv2. If I were to actually build this, I would run MobileNet on a Raspberry Pi with the CORAL USB Accelerator.
